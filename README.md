# FLUXIAN PROGRAMMING TEST
construct a basic scramble function

## Instructions
- the api needs to be on port 4139
- the front end can be on any port

```
bash init.sh
```

the bas script should work
if it does not

```
chmod +x init.sh
cd ui
chmod +x start.sh
```

## Stack
### API
-liberator
### Front End
- fulcro

I did not use Fulcro's built in server just went with liberator

tests are in server (did not test ui)
